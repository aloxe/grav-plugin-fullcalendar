# Fullcalendar Plugin

The **Fullcalendar** Plugin is for [Grav CMS](http://github.com/getgrav/grav). It reads ICS Calendar Files and shows Events in a monthly Calendar Widget on your Page(s) - including Month Specific Images (if available in the calendar page folder):

## Installation

Installing the Fullcalendar plugin can be done in one of two ways. The GPM (Grav Package Manager) installation method enables you to quickly and easily install the plugin with a simple terminal command, while the manual method enables you to do so via a zip file.

### GPM Installation (Preferred)

The simplest way to install this plugin is via the [Grav Package Manager (GPM)](http://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/grav-gpm) through your system's terminal (also called the command line).  From the root of your Grav install type:

    bin/gpm install fullcalendar

This will install the Fullcalendar plugin into your `/user/plugins` directory within Grav. Its files can be found under `/your/site/grav/user/plugins/fullcalendar`.

### Manual Installation

To install this plugin, just download the zip version of this repository and unzip it under `/your/site/grav/user/plugins`. Then, rename the folder to `fullcalendar`. You can find these files on [GitHub](https://github.com/wernerjoss/grav-plugin-fullcalendar) or via [GetGrav.org](https://getgrav.org/downloads/plugins).

You should now have all the plugin files under

    /your/site/grav/user/plugins/fullcalendar

> NOTE: This plugin is a modular component for Grav which requires [Grav](http://github.com/getgrav/grav) and the [Error](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-error) and [Problems](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-problems) Plugins to operate.

### Admin Plugin

If you use the admin plugin, you can install directly through the admin plugin by browsing the `Plugins` tab and clicking on the `Add` button.

## Configuration

Before configuring this plugin, you should copy the `user/plugins/fullcalendar/fullcalendar.yaml` to `user/config/plugins/fullcalendar.yaml` and only edit that copy.  
Note that if you use the admin plugin, the file with your configuration, named fullcalendar.yaml will be saved in the `user/config/plugins/` folder once the configuration is saved in the admin.  
There is also a simple UI in the admin Backend that provides basic customizations.

Here is the default configuration and an explanation of available options:

```yaml

enabled: true
colors: "#3a87ad" # see additional Note on custom colors in the Changelog, be sure to use single or double quotes around list !
: false   # set to true to show calendar File Name(s) as Legend below grid
weekNumbers: false  # set to true to show Week Numbers
useCustomPageTemplate: false    # Use another Template than 'calendar' for Calendar Page (e.g. in case of modular Page)
```

## Usage

Once installed and enabled, you can use this Plugin to parse ICS Calendar File(s) (these must be found in user/data/calendars and set as parameter in Plugin shortcode, without Path !) and display Events from that Calendar(s) anywhere on your Site using this shortcode:

    [fullcalendar icsfile="example0.ics,example1.ics,..."][/fullcalendar]

in the appropriate page (note the double quotes " surrounding the file name - single quotes ' will not work !)    
You can also provide absolute URL's to ICS Files, in which case a CORS proxy will be used to access them.  
As an addition, you can show a Picture for the current month above the calendar widget.  
Just put 12 Image Files named 'January.jpg', 'February.jpg', ... , 'December.jpg' in the Folder for your Page where the Calendar will be placed.
(Note that Image File names must match Month names according to your locale setting, so, for locale: de, use 'Januar.jpg' ...).  
From Version 0.2.6, it is also possible to just drop .ics Calendar Files into your page folder, they will be picked up and used like those in /user/data/calendars.  
In case you only use calendar files in the page folder, be sure to include an empty shortcut:   
` [fullcalendar][/fullcalendar]`   
in your page content, otherwise it will not work !  
Also note, that from v 0.2.8, the Plugin will only work if you use the calendar.html.twig template from the plugin (or a modified copy in your Theme Folder) for the calendar page - this can be done manually or in the admin backend by choosing 'Calendar' in the dropdown for the page template.  
Additionally, it should be noted that this Plugin relies on jquery beeing loaded by the Theme (most Themes do this) - in case you are using a Theme that does not do this, there is now (from v 0.2.10) a configuration Option to resolve this Problem: just set addJquery to true.

## Advanced Usage
As an addition to the standard use case, there is an elegant way to automatically update your .ics Files from remote Calendars in case those are hosted on a CalDav Server (e.g. Owncloud, Nextcloud...):  
In this case, you can just use [caldav2ics](https://github.com/wernerjoss/caldav2ics) via cron job or the [Grav Scheduler](https://learn.getgrav.org/17/advanced/scheduler) to automatically update your ics Files shown by the Fullcalendar Plugin, so that remote Calendar content, usually maintained in separate Calendar Apps (such as Google Calendar or Lightning) is automatically propagated to your Website.  
The same is true if you install [grav-plugin-caldav2ics](https://github.com/wernerjoss/grav-plugin-caldav2ics) which is fully integrated in Grav and has a nice Admin Backend for easy configuration.

## CORS Issues:
As of Begin 2021, I realized, that the recommended external CORS Proxy (herokuapp, see above) will no longer work for public use, see [this support Thread](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere/issues/301).
So I decided to implement a local CORS Proxy, which is available from v 0.2.8. that should work in all cases. The proxy should be in http://yourdomain/(your_grav_path)/user/plugins/fullcalendar/proxy.php/.

## Credits

This Plugin is built on [fullcalendar.io](https://fullcalendar.io), [jakubroztocil/rrule](https://github.com/jakubroztocil/rrule) and [jsical](http://mozilla-comm.github.io/ical.js) - Javascript parser for rfc5545

## To Do

* Implement EXDATE/EXRULE rrule exceptions
* Upgrade included Fullcalendar.io to Version 5 (currently: Version 4)
